# Credit-card-fraud-detection

In the credit card fraud detection system project, a machine learning-based model was developed to identify fraudulent transactions with high accuracy. The project involved a comprehensive data pipeline starting with data cleaning to remove inconsistencies and prepare the dataset for analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to uncover patterns and correlations within the data, providing insights that informed the next steps.

Data manipulation techniques were employed to engineer features that would enhance the model's predictive power. Data visualization was also utilized to identify trends and outliers, aiding in the understanding of the dataset's structure.

A machine learning model was then developed using advanced algorithms tailored to detect fraud. The model was rigorously evaluated, ensuring it could accurately differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives and negatives.

The final model was integrated into a Python application, providing a seamless interface for real-time fraud detection. This system not only enhances security for credit card transactions but also offers scalability for large-scale financial data, making it a valuable tool in combating credit card fraud. The project showcases the effective use of data science and machine learning techniques in solving real-world financial challenges.
